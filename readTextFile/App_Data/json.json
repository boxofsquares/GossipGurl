So put out your night look and get ready to party.\r\n\r\nApparently the D is hosting a party. B is attending, but what about the rest? Last we heard the D might have overcrowded his guestlist, yet he surely managed to make space for R. But did he make space for A? Well, we know Alexa craves for a D, but if an offer came from this D, would she accept the offer? I doubt it. And why has the D invited R? First of all we know R has been quite lonely in his house alone. But is an offer of D a worthy cause for R? I guess the D is making an attempt to be friends, but I guess he did not get the memo. Cause R is not really interested in people who blows off his friends. So the real question is will R attend the party? That’s the secret we want to know. You know you love me, \r\nXOXO Gossip Gurl",
